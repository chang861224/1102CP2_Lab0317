I'll Wait
I'll never forget the songs we used to play
And when I put 'em on
The feeling never fades out my body
I hope you're thinkin' of me (mmm)
There won't be a night, there won't be a place
Where you don't cross my mind
Where I don't see your face in somebody (mmm)
I hope you're thinkin' of me (mmm)
People say we're fools, people say we're dumb
People say we're caught up in temporary love
We don't know what we're doin', they say we're too young
But they don't know a thing about us
I'll wait forever, that's what we said
16th of September, lyin' in my bed
I'll wait forever, it's never too late
Couple thousand miles is just a little space
I'll wait (mmm)
I'll wait (mmm)
I'll wait (mmm)
Couple thousand miles is just a little space
I'll wait
I'll wait
There won't be an end, can't forget the start
When you're far away, it's like we're not apart
I'd play my money
Just to hear you say you love me again
People say we're fools, people say we're dumb
People say we're caught up in temporary love
We don't know what we're doin', they say we're too young
But they don't know a thing about us
I'll wait forever, that's what we said
16th of September, lyin' in my bed
I'll wait forever, it's never too late
Couple thousand miles is just a little space
I'll wait (mmm)
I'll wait (mmm)
I'll wait (mmm)
Couple thousand miles is just a little space
I'll wait
I'll wait (mmm)
I'll wait (mmm)
I'll wait (mmm)
Couple thousand miles is just a little space
I'll wait forever, that's what we said
16th of September, lyin' in my bed
I'll wait forever, it's never too late
Couple thousand miles is just a little space
I'll wait
