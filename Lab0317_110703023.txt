for the first time in forever
Anna: The window is open, so's that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they're opening up the gates

There'll be actual real live people
It'll be totally strange
But wow, am I so ready for this change

'Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night

Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone
Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

I can't wait to meet everyone! (gasp)
What if I meet... the one?

Tonight imagine me gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
Ooh! I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

But then we laugh and talk all evening,
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've lead so far

For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone

And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

Elsa: Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

Elsa: But it's only for today
Anna: It's only for today

Elsa: It's agony to wait
Anna: It's agony to wait

Elsa: Tell the guards to open up the gate
Anna: The gate

Anna For the first time in forever
Elsa: Don't let them in, don't let them see

Anna: I'm getting what I'm dreaming of
Elsa: Be the good girl you always have to be

Anna: A chance to change my lonely world
Elsa: Conceal

Anna: A chance to find true love
Elsa: Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

Anna: I know it all ends tomorrow,
So it has to be today
'Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way!
