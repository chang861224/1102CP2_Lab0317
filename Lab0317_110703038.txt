8 Letters

You know me the best
You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge
That right there is the scariest feeling
Opening and closing up again
I've been hurt, so I don't trust
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling
I've said those words before, but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close?
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align?
When your hand's in mine
It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign?
I should speak my mind
I've said those words before, but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close?
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say? (Woah, oh yeah)
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close?
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (it's only you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters


Sunshine

You're like a sunshine, only giving good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it (know it)
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
Hey, everyone's trying to be the same, yeah
'Til I met you, I was on that wave
But you really on something different
You do you, it must be nice
And I think it's rubbin' off on me
Oh, yeah, step to the left, step to the right, do what you want
What really matters is the journey that we're on
Yeah, riding with you, I finally know where I belong
I belong
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it (know it)
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
Oh, I was feeling so invisible, yeah
I didn't know this could be possible (no)
Alright, but you really on something different
You do you, just work it out
And I think it's rubbing off on me
Oh, yeah, step to the left, step to the right, do what you want
What really matters is the journey that we're on
Yeah, riding with you, I finally know where I belong
I belong
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it (know it)
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (you're my sunshine)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (you're my sunshine)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
Oh, oh
