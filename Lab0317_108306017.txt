Officially missing you, take one
All I hear is raindrops
Falling on the rooftop
Oh, baby tell me why'd you have to go
'Cause this pain I feel
It won't go away
And today I'm officially missing you
I thought that from this heartache
I could escape
But I fronted long enough to know
There ain't no way
And today
I'm officially missing you
Oh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey, baby say it stays on my mind
And I (and I), I'm officially
All I do is lay around
Two years full of tears
From looking at your face on the wall (face on the wall)
Just a week ago you were my baby
Now I don't even know you at all
I don't know you at all
Well, I wish that you would call me right now
So that I could get through to you somehow
But I guess it's safe to say, baby, safe to say
That I'm (that I'm) officially missing you
Oh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey, baby, say it stays on my mind
And I (and I), I'm officially
Well, I thought I could just get over you baby
But I see that's something I just can't do
From the way you would hold me
To the sweet things you told me
I just can't find a way
To let go of you
Oh, can't nobody do it like you (like you)
Said every little thing you do
Hey, baby, say it stays on my mind
And I (and I), I'm officially
It's official
Oh, you know that I'm missing you, yeah, yes
All I hear is raindrops
And I'm officially missing you
