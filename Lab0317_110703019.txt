A Sky Full of Stars

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, oo-oo, oo-oo
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars (full of stars)
I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark (gets dark)
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, oo-oo, oo-oo
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
