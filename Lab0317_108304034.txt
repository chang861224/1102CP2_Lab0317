Somehow

Lying still in this bed, but my heart is restless
Chasing the last words you said
Every bit of regret, I swallow with each breath
Wishing I had done, more than what I had done
Your memory. It shadows me wherever I go
And I wonder how
I made it through another day alone
Irregular, there's nothing normal
This shouldn't be
Who I am without you is a bad dream
Cause I can't see the end of these tears I cry
And I can't see the end, of these sleepless nights
But I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
Yes, I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
Standing back against the wall
My heart is bleeding for your call
If I could only hear your voice again tonight
I could show you all the joy you bring
Not just feel you in my dreams
I need you here right now
I need you stay somehow
Your memory. It shadows me wherever I go
And I wonder how
I made it through another day alone
Irregular, there's nothing normal
This shouldn't be
Who I am without you is a bad dream
Cause I can't see the end of these tears I cry
And I can't see the end, of these sleepless nights
But I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
Yes, I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Cause I can't see the end of these tears I cry
And I can't see the end, of these sleepless nights
But I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
Yes, I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
Cause I can't see the end of these tears I cry
And I can't see the end, of these sleepless nights
But I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
Yes, I want you somehow. Somehow. Somehow
