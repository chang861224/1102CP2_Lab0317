Put_your_head_on_my_shoulder_song

Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby?
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe 
You and I will fall in love (you and I will fall in love)
People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way 
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, tell me
Tell me that you love me too (tell me that you love me too)
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby
Put your head on my shoulder
