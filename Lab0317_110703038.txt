Sunshine

You're like a sunshine, only giving good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it (know it)
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
Hey, everyone's trying to be the same, yeah
'Til I met you, I was on that wave
But you really on something different
You do you, it must be nice
And I think it's rubbin' off on me
Oh, yeah, step to the left, step to the right, do what you want
What really matters is the journey that we're on
Yeah, riding with you, I finally know where I belong
I belong
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it (know it)
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
Oh, I was feeling so invisible, yeah
I didn't know this could be possible (no)
Alright, but you really on something different
You do you, just work it out
And I think it's rubbing off on me
Oh, yeah, step to the left, step to the right, do what you want
What really matters is the journey that we're on
Yeah, riding with you, I finally know where I belong
I belong
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it (know it)
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (roll in)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (you're my sunshine)
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any-anytime that you roll in (you're my sunshine)
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
Oh, oh
You're my sunshine, only good vibes
You're my sunshine, sunshine
